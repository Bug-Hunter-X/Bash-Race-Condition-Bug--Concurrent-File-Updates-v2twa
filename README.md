This repository contains a simple bash script that demonstrates a race condition bug.  The script creates two files and updates them concurrently. Due to the lack of synchronization, data corruption can occur.  The bug is demonstrated in `bug.sh`, and a solution is provided in `bugSolution.sh`.  The solution uses flock to ensure that only one process can update a file at a time, preventing race conditions and data corruption.
